# 3.14  Exercises

## Exercise 1  
Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named *s* as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

```
>>> right_justify('monty')
                                                                 monty
```
Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('monty') is 5.

## Exercise 2  
A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

```
def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()
```

Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.

```
def print_spam():
    print('spam')

do_twice(print_spam)
```

Type this example into a script and test it.
Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.

## Exercise 3  
Note: This exercise should be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far.

Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
```
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
```
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence of values:
```
>>> print('+', '-')
+ -
```
By default, print advances to the next line, but you can override that behavior and put a space at the end, like this:
```
print('+', end=' ')
print('-')
```
The output of these statements is '+ -' on the same line. The output from the next print statement would begin on the next line.

Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.

# The game of Nims/Stones

In this game, two players sit in front of a pile of 100 stones. They take turns, each removing between 1 and 5 stones (assuming there are at least 5 stones left in the pile). The person who removes the last stone(s) wins.

Download nims.py from the website and open it up. Check out the lines of text in between the sets of ’’’, underneath the definition of play nims. This is called a docstring, and is handy to use to tell users of your program what parameters to pass in, and what your program does.

In this problem, you’ll write a function to play this game; we’ve outlined it for you. It may seem tricky, so break it down into parts. Like many programs, we have to use nested loops (one loop inside another). In the outermost loop, we want to keep playing until we are out of stones. Inside that, we want to keep alternating players. You have the option of either writing two blocks of code, or keeping a variable that tracks the current player. The second way could be slightly trickier, but it’s definitely do-able!

Finally, we might want to have an innermost loop that checks if the user’s input is valid. Is it a number? Is it a valid number (e.g. between 1 and 5)? Are there enough stones in the pile to take off this many? If any of these answers are no, we should tell the user and re-ask them the question.

As always, feel free to ask the teachers for help on any part of this problem.

If you choose to write two blocks of code, the basic outline of the program should be something like this:
```python
while [pile is not empty]:
    while [player 1’s answer is not valid]:
        [ask player 1]
    [execute player 1’s move]
    [same as above for player 2]
```

Be careful with the validity checks. Specifically, we want to keep asking player 1 for their choice as long as their answer is not valid, BUT we want to make sure we ask them at least ONCE. So, for example, we will want to keep a variable that tracks whether their answer is valid, and set it to False initially.

When you’re finished, test each other’s programs by playing them!
